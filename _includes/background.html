      As a partner focused engineer, I enjoy bridging the gap between
      engineering, business development, partnerships, and so many other skill
      sets &mdash; combining my technical knowledge with my need to work with
      people. My goal is to engage with partners and help them build amazing new
      features and products using our APIs.

      mixing up a cocktail, rock climbing, traveling the world with my wife, or
      hanging out with my cat. <span class="emoji arya"></span>
